Hello, and Welcome to my Repo.  This App here is a basic E-Commerece website for the sale of Computer parts.  This was built using the MERN stack.
Utilizing the passport library to create and and manage user data, react-router-dom to switch pages, fuse.js to help with fuzzy searches and more.
Feel free to clone and play around with the code and make it your own.

This product uses a number of technologies, namely React, MongoDB, Passport, Fuse, Express, Axios, BCrypt, Cors, and Mongoose.



To get started working with this Repo all one hase to do is click the Green code button on the main page and coby the HTTPS link.
Then in your terminal type "git clone <Repo Link> rename".  After cloning be sure to run "npm install" to  install all needed dependencies.

Still working on keeping track of previous orders.
